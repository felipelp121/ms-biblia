but not to his offspring, for it will be uprooted; and his kingdom will be for the others and not for these: but not with the same authority as his."},{"number":5,"text":"And the king of the south will be strong, but one of his captains will be stronger than he and will be ruler; and his rule will be a great rule."},{"number":6,"text":"And at the end of years they will be joined together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she will not keep the strength of her arm;

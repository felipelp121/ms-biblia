And Amnon said to him, I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom&#x27;s sister."},{"number":5,"text":"Then Jonadab said to him, Go to your bed, and let it seem that you are ill: and when your father comes to see you, say to him, Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread, and get the food ready before my eyes, so that I may see it and take it from her hand."},{"number":6,"text":"So Amnon went to bed and made himself seem ill: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let my sister Tamar come and make me one or two cakes before my eyes, so that I may take food from her hand."},{"number":7,"text":"Then David sent to the house for Tamar and said, Go now to your brother Amnon&#x27;s house and get a meal for him."},{"number":8,"text":"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#x27;s house; and he was in bed.

And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you?"},{"number":27,"text":"But Absalom went on requesting him till he let Amnon and all the king&#x27;s sons go with him. And Absalom made a great feast like a feast for a king."},{"number":28,"text":"Now Absalom had given orders to his servants, saying, Now take note when Amnon&#x27;s heart is glad with wine; and when I say to you, Make an attack on Amnon, then put him to death without fear: have I not given you orders? be strong and without fear."},{"number":29,"text":"So Absalom&#x27;s servants did to Amnon as Absalom had given them orders.
